# ShowGlyphsInLabelColor.glyphsReporter

This is a plugin for the [Glyphs font editor](http://glyphsapp.com/) by Georg Seifert.
It displays glyphs in Edit View in their respective label color. It only colors the backgrounds, so you should turn off *View > Fill Preview* if you also want to see inactive glyphs in their label color.
After installation, it will add the menu item *View > Show Glyphs in Label Color*.
You can set a keyboard shortcut in System Preferences.

### Installation

1. Download the complete ZIP file and unpack it, or clone the repository.
2. Double click the .glyphsReporter file. Confirm the dialog that appears in Glyphs.
3. Restart Glyphs

### Usage Instructions

1. Open a glyph in Edit View.
2. Use *View > Show Glyphs in Label Color* to toggle the display of glyphs in their respective label colors.

### Requirements

The plugin needs Glyphs 1.4.3 or higher, running on OS X 10.7 or later. I can only test it in current OS versions, and I assume it will not work in versions of Mac OS X older than 10.7.
